# LeoBeats-Website
Website dedicated to storing and listening to music
Created a website for a design class implementing the use ofhtml, mySQL and php to connect the database.

The purpose of creation was to hopefully make an application for other students at Texas A&M Commerce to store and listen to their favorite songs stored in one location. 

Regretfully, I created all my source code within the host website instead of my local machine. The host website automatically deleted my account with all my code included after a year of inactivity. 

The repository has a powerpoint (LeoBeatsDesign.pptx) showing my timeframe for completion, the database's design and some source code for the functionality and features. The repository also contains a video (LeoBeatsDemonstration.mp4) in which the website's functionalities and features are tested. The functionalities include: a dark mode, search and sort, insert and delete.
